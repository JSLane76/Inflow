# User Management Technical Exercise


### 1. Filters Section (Standard) - DONE

### 2. User Model Properties (Standard) - DONE

### 3. Actions Section (Standard) - DONE

### 4. Data Logging (Advanced) - DONE Added ability to view logs for a particular user from the view screen with filtering on entry type. Deleted users can be seen from the main list screen. Ive used a static class for logging in a real world scenario you wouldnt want to persist the logging information in memory. A future improvment here would be to create all log entries asynchronously. 

### 5. Extend the Application (Expert) - Done some bundling and Minification work

### 6. Future-Proof the Application (Platform) - Added a CI pipeline which runs the provided tests and builds the application

## Additional Notes

* I installed the extention 'Bundler & Minifier 2022+ 2.99 by Jason Moore' to do the bundling
